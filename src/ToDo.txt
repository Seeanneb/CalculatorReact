Create a calculator that accepts a users first number
The user then selects an operator
a second number is entered
an answer is contrived between the 2 numbers selected and the operator chosen

1. The body of the calculator on the screen
2. making inputs validate as only numbers either by clicking the screen or keyboard
3. storing the inputs into variables
4. creating operator functions.
5. displaying the answer on the screen. 
6. clearing the result. 


User enters numbers
if the decimal is used, it cannot be used again in the array 
allow 9 digits in the array 
when an operator is pushed, use boolean to end the first number array
start counting the second array also following the 1 decimal rule and 9 numbers
push the 2 numbers and operator into a function
